## 3.初めての起動

### 3-1. Terraform の初期化

初期化前に、terraform ディレクトリへ移動する:

```bash
cd terraform
```

初期化を実行する:

```bash
terraform init
```

出力ログは以下のようになる:

```bash
Initializing the backend...
Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding latest version of hashicorp/aws...
- Installing hashicorp/aws v5.100.0...
- Installed hashicorp/aws v5.100.0 (signed by HashiCorp)
Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
```

このコマンドは、Terraform のワークスペースを初期化し、必要なプラグインやプロバイダーをダウンロードする。

### 3-2. Terraform の実行

実行前に、`terraform plan` コマンドを実行して、リソースの作成計画を確認する:

```bash
terraform plan
```

このコマンドは Terraform の重要なコマンドの一つで、実際にリソースを作成・変更・削除する前に、何が実行されるかを確認するためのコマンドになる。

出力コマンドは以下のようになる:

```bash
Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # aws_instance.hello-world will be created
  + resource "aws_instance" "hello-world" {

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.ｓ
```

今回は EC2 インスタンスを新規作成するので、`ami`と`instance_type`が新たに追加されていることがわかる。

```bash
terraform apply
```

このコマンドは、Terraform の計画を実行し、AWS にリソースをプロビジョニングする。

出力ログは以下のようになり、ログの途中で`Enter a value:`と問われるので`yes`と入力する。

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes
